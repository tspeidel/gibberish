Much hype is generated from technology consulting firms and vendors.
This has led firms like Gartner to publish the now popular ???[Hype
Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle)???.

This is a **humorous collection** of (loosely) convincing sentences I
generated based on training data found on the website of 5 popular
technology vendor and consulting firms. Of course, the selection of the
training data is biased, as I only looked for areas where buzzwords are
common.

The generator uses a [Markov
chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain), a true random
process model, not another meaningless term.

``` r
## Load data
# cname <- file.path("F:/GoogleDrive/Personal_Work/Gibberish_Generator/Data")

cname <- file.path("/home/tspeidel/GoogleDrive/Personal_Work/Gibberish_Generator/Data")

docs <- VCorpus(DirSource(cname))
docs <-data.frame(text = unlist(sapply(docs, `[`, "content")), stringsAsFactors = F)


## Cleanup
docs <- docs %>%
  filter(cumsum(text == "") > 0,
         cumsum(str_detect(text, "^--")) == 0) %>%
  drop_empty_row() %>%
  tibble::rowid_to_column("id")

docs$text <- strip(docs$text, char.keep = c("?", ",", ";", "."))
docs$text <- replace_contraction(docs$text)
docs$text <- replace_html(docs$text)
docs$text <- replace_non_ascii(docs$text)
docs$text <- replace_number(docs$text, remove=TRUE)
docs$text <- replace_symbol(docs$text)
docs$text <- replace_white(docs$text)



## Markov model
buzz <- docs %>% pull(text)

markov_model <-
  generate_markovify_model(
    input_text = buzz,
    markov_state_size = 2L,
    max_overlap_total = 25,
    max_overlap_ratio = .85
  )


buzz.out <- markovify_text(
  markov_model = markov_model,
  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,
  output_column_name = "Gibberish",
  count = 30,
  tries = 200,
  only_distinct = TRUE,
  return_message = FALSE
)
```

Output
======

And hereâ€™s the output. It needs some more cleaning (capitalization,
punctuation and more verbs):

``` r
kable(buzz.out, "html", align = "l", digits = 1) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), full_width = F, position = "left")

Spicing it up with Trump
